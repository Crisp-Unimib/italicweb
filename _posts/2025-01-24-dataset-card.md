## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this dataset is. -->

We present _ITALIC_, a large-scale benchmark dataset of 10,000 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate the natural language understanding of the Italian language and culture.
_ITALIC_ spans 12 domains, exploiting public tests to score domain experts in real-world scenarios.
We detail our data collection process, stratification techniques, and selection strategies.

_ITALIC_ provides a comprehensive assessment suite that captures commonsense reasoning and linguistic proficiency in a morphologically rich language.
It serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models and as a roadmap for future research, encouraging the development of more sophisticated and culturally aware natural language systems.
